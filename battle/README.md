# Battleships in Python!

Hi, this is our implementation of the battleships game.

### Missing game functionality/features

 1. Error checking (we can still place ships on occupied slots)
 2. Missing bonus rounds for hitting opponents
 3. Have a nicer looking grid with better ascii render
 
### Code improvements:

 - The classes aren't implemented correctly
 - It needs exception handling (e.g. when someone puts text instead of numbers, the program should prompt another attempt instead of crashing)
 - Wrap everything in functions and call them from the main loop.
